Sure, here are 10 simple array-related questions that involve using loops in Java:

1. **Array Sum:** Write a Java program to calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array.

2. **Array Average:** Create a Java program that calculates the average of values in a double array.

3. **Maximum Value:** Write a Java function to find the maximum value in an array of integers.

4. **Minimum Value:** Create a Java program to find the minimum value in an array of doubles.

5. **Array Reversal:** Implement a Java function that reverses the elements in an integer array using a loop.

6. **Array Search:** Write a Java program to search for a specific element in an array of strings and return its index.

7. **Array Copy:** Create a Java function that copies the elements of one integer array into another.

8. **Array Sorting:** Implement a Java program to sort an array of integers in ascending order using a loop.

9. **Array Filtering:** Write a Java function that removes all occurrences of a specified value from an array of integers.
